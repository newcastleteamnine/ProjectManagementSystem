1.Still can not decide the relation between member and task.
2.For member,maybe they can manage their task,make a plan how to finish job.while submit task,set the status of task to finished.
3.Groupleader will submit project while all the tasks have been finished,then perhaps dismiss the group and apply to delete the account for leader?
4.How to create Admin?apply from website or just set them in the database(should need more than one admin)

5.Process:admin -->create member; create project ;create group(status should be incomplete ata first and match connect project) & create leader;
          groupleader -->add member ; allocate task  ;submit while all finished
          member -->can manage own task(divide into parts) & submit task
